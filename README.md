# MIPI-to-BTB-40-pin-AMOLED

This PCB takes a 4 lane MIPI DSI input from for example a raspberry pi 5 and makes it compatible with a 40 pin 5806 Board to Board connector used on the TOP055FHDTOOCTP01 AMOLED display

# Warning:
Please make sure that the display that you use has a connector that is pin to pin compatible with this design. If it isnt, then feel free to change it to your display using its provided datasheet.
